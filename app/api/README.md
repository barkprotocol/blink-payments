## Introduction

BARK - Blink Payments is designed to facilitate payments using BARK, SEND, SOL, USDC, and SPL tokens on the Solana blockchain. This project showcases how to integrate token payments into a web application, with a focus on efficient transaction handling and user interactions.

## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/barkprotocol/bark-blink-payments.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```sh
   cd bark-blink-payments && app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

   If using TypeScript, you may also need:

   ```sh
   npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/node
   ```

4. **Create a `.env` file:**

   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure it with your environment variables:
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit `.env` to include:
   ```plaintext
   SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOWED_ORIGIN=http://yourdomain.com
   REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
   ```

## Development

To start the development server, use:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This command will start the server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and you can view changes in real-time as you develop.

## Usage

### API Routes

The project includes API routes to handle payments:

- **`/api/receive-payment`**: Endpoint to receive BARK tokens.
- **`/api/send-token`**: Endpoint to send SEND tokens.

You can test these endpoints using tools like Postman or directly through the provided web interface.

### Components

Components for the application are located in the `components/` directory:

- **`components/Header.tsx`**: The header component for navigating the application.
- **`components/Footer.tsx`**: The footer component displayed at the bottom of each page.

### Utilities

Utility functions are in the `utils/` directory:

- **`utils/utils.ts`**: General utility functions, including URL and fetch handling.
- **`utils/helpers.ts`**: Functions for specific tasks like interacting with the Solana blockchain.

## Scripts

Here are some common scripts you can use:

- `dev` - Start the development server.
- `build` - Build the application for production.
- `start` - Run the application in production mode.
- `lint` - Lint the codebase.
- `lint:fix` - Fix linting issues.

For example, to build the application for production, use:

```sh
npm run build
```

## Production Deployment

### Environment Variables

Ensure all sensitive data (API keys, secrets) are stored securely using environment variables and not hard-coded in the application.

**Create a `.env` file for local development:**
```plaintext
SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOWED_ORIGIN=http://yourdomain.com
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

**Configure production environment variables securely:**
- Use a secret management service or environment variable storage provided by your hosting provider (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or Heroku Config Vars).

### Monitoring and Alerts

**Set up monitoring and alerts using tools like Datadog, Prometheus, or similar:**

- **Datadog:**
  - Install Datadog Agent and configure APM.
  - Create custom alerts based on application performance metrics.

- **Prometheus and Grafana:**
  - Install Prometheus and Grafana.
  - Set up Prometheus exporter for Node.js.
  - Configure Grafana dashboards for visualizing metrics.

### Performance Optimization

**Implement caching strategies and use CDNs:**

- **In-Memory Caching with Redis:**
  ```typescript
  import Redis from 'ioredis';

  const redis = new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL);

  // Set a cache entry
  await redis.set('key', 'value', 'EX', 3600); // Expires in 1 hour

  // Get a cache entry
  const value = await redis.get('key');
  ```

- **HTTP Caching:**
  ```typescript
  import express from 'express';
  const app = express();

  app.use((req, res, next) => {
    res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'public, max-age=3600'); // Cache for 1 hour
    next();
  });
  ```

- **Use CDN for Static Assets:**
  - Configure your CDN provider (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront) to cache and serve static assets.

### Security Best Practices

**Apply security headers and perform security audits:**

- **Security Headers:**
  ```typescript
  import helmet from 'helmet';

  app.use(helmet());
  ```

- **Regularly Update Dependencies and Perform Security Audits:**
  ```sh
  npm update
  npm audit
  ```

**Implement Secure Authentication and Authorization:**
- Ensure user authentication is secure using standards like OAuth 2.0 or JWT.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive operations.
